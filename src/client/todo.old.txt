Here lie old todo items / notes that I'm not planning on implementing,
but want to keep around for reference.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Socket stuff:
   - add any process displays before socket foo in notebook
   - subscribe to new window creation messages, to allow auto-swallowing
     - Hmm.  So we need to get CreateNotify XEvents from the root
       window.  Or not.  XLib manual says CreateNotify is generated
       when _children_ are created.  Damn.  Thus, this will only be
       generated from the root window.  Need some way to subscribe to
       events from the root.  Really, need a way to get events from
       another window.  Options:
       - Use IPC's subscribeFD to get events from the root window
       - Install GDK filter on XEvents
       - Connect some sort of GTK signal handler to GDK_ROOT_WINDOW...
       - Do straight X stuff a la on_swallow_window1_activate
     - sometimes works, sometimes leaves skeleton window, sometimes
       just resizes window (timing issue)
              
       Occasionaly GDK bad window error that crashes claw; not sure what
       it's from:
         Entering FD handler
         Gdk-ERROR **: BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)
           serial 12 error_code 3 request_code 20 minor_code 0
       This seems to happen when you close an arbitrary window soon after
       it appearing...  Maybe add some sort of "does this window still
       exist" check?  It's a race condition...

   - detect closing of window & do cleanup
     - look at XLib stuff, or maybe GDK
   - save geometry of windows when swallowed, to allow its restoration
     after regurgitation
