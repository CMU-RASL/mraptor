For setting up mraptor services:
* copy mraptord.conf to /etc/.
* copy mraptord.service and ipc.service to /etc/systemd/system/.
* if pkaction --version < 0.106:
    copy 50-mraptor.pkla to /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/.
  else
    copy 50-mraptor.rules to /etc/polkit-1/rules.d
* for all files make them root:root with permission 0644

* do: 
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable ipc.service
    sudo systemctl enable mraptord.service
* after that, can start/stop/restart simply with:
    systemctl <verb> mraptord.servic (no need to start IPC separately)
* you can check if they've started with:
    ps -auxw | grep central
  you should see both central and mraptord running


mraptord and mraptord.sysv are older versions 
  and may or may not still work on older systems
