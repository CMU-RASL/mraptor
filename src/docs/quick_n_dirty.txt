Hrm, someone impatient maybe?  Here's the quicklike install
instructions; we assume a RedHat 7 or greater boot system and that
you've grabbed the tarball off of the website.

Scenario:
  There are three computers on the robot: larry.r, mo.r, and curly.r.
  There are two laptops that will be used as chase computers: bo.c and
  luke.c

Compile microraptor
  Target: All systems.
    The Microraptor source tree expects to be installed under a software/
    directory.  You must create an external/ directory in software/ which
    includes the IPC installation (potentially via symlinks to a
    previously-installed copy):

    * Choose a directory for your installation and do the following:

      setenv ATACAMA_MEMBERS_DIR <your_dir>
      mkdir $ATACAMA_MEMBERS_DIR/software

    * Set up the external directory under software to include the IPC
      installation.  An example of how to do this if you have access to the
      FIRE project afs space:

      cd $ATACAMA_MEMBERS_DIR/software
      ln -s /afs/cs/project/fire/software/external external

      (the requirement is that the following files be present)

      software/external/lib/Linux-2.4/libipc.a
      software/external/bin/Linux-2.4/central
      software/external/include/ipc.h
      (your kernel version may vary)

    * Install the Microraptor source.  Pick one: grabbing it from CVS
      or downloading the source tarball from
      www.ciabuggy.org/brennan/mraptor.

      CVS:
        cd $ATACAMA_MEMBERS_DIR/software
        setenv CVSROOT monk.frc.ri.cmu.edu:/user/atacama/software/master
        cvs checkout src/microraptor
        cvs checkout src/microraptor/atacama_env
      Tarball:
        Download tarball from www.ciabuggy.org/brennan/mraptor
        cd $ATACAMA_MEMBERS_DIR/software
        tar -xzf tarball.tgz        

    * Pick up environment variables from atacama_env.

      source $ATACAMA_MEMBERS_DIR/software/src/atacama_env

    * Compile

      If you don't want the executables, libraries, and headers
      installed to $ATACAMA_MEMBERS_DIR/software/bin/<architecture>,
      set the RELEASE_HOME environment variable.

      cd $ATACAMA_MEMBERS_DIR/software/src/microraptor
      gmake RELEASE=1 install

      (this produces the following files, which should be in your path
       if you rehash; note that compiling with RELEASE=1 removes -g
       and adds -O3, resulting in much longer compile times but much
       faster executables (esp. the GUI, claw))

      software/bin/linux2/mraptord
      software/bin/linux2/mrterm
      software/bin/linux2/claw
    
Run daemon on boot with config file and start central
  Target: larry.r (one robot machine, first to boot)

  Insert the lines below into /etc/rc.local (assumes rc.local is in
  tcsh format):

    set path = (. $path)
    setenv CENTRALHOST larry.r:1382
    sudo -H -u mraptor_user /path/to/IPC/bin/central -lx -u -p1382 >& /dev/null &
    sudo -H -u mraptor_user /path/to/mraptord -c /path/to/config/file/my.config  >& /dev/null &

  where mraptor_user is a non-root (and privledge-restricted) user
  that has the rights to run all programs you'll be controlling with
  microraptor.

Run daemon on boot
  Target: mo.r and curl.r (rest of robot machines)

  Insert the lines below into /etc/rc.local (assumes rc.local is in
  tcsh format):

    set path = (. $path)
    setenv CENTRALHOST larry.r:1382
    sudo -H -u mraptor_user /path/to/mraptord >& /dev/null &

Run clients
  Target: bo.c and luke.c (any machine that wants to connect)

  setenv CENTRALHOST larry.r:1382
  claw

Note that we run a central on port 1382 (the standard is 1381) for all
microraptor foo; if you use IPC as part of your system (and you should
:), run your central on the standard port 1381; this way, microraptor
will not interfere with your system whatsoever.

And play!  See mraptor_manual.txt for details about everything.  It's
not quite done yet with respect to claw (the GUI client), so skim it,
but then just play with claw. :)
