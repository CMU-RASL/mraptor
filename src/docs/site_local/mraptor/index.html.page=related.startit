      <meta name="description" content="A review of StartIt, a project
somewhat similar to Microraptor.">
<h2>StartIt</h2>
<b>Developed by:</b> SRI<br>
<b>Part of:</b> The Open Agent Architecture (OAA)<br>
<b>URL:</b> <a
href="http://www.ai.sri.com/oaa/distribution/v2.3/doc/agents/startit/startit-doc.html">http://www.ai.sri.com/oaa/distribution/v2.3/doc/agents/startit/startit-doc.html</a><br>
<b>Date Reviewed:</b> Sept. 20, 2005<br>
<b>Version Reviewed:</b> Documentation for version 2.3.0, August 2003<br>
<b>Reviewed by:</b> Brennan Sellner<br>

<p class="content">At a glance, this looks like a somewhat more
graphical version of Microraptor.  However, there are a number of
important differences (in no particular order):</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Process interaction:</b> StartIt does not appear to allow the
  user to interact with running processes via stdin, although it does
  provide a tabbed log of stdout/stderr output.  Microraptor provides
  nearly complete terminal emulation (with the exception of control
  sequences such as Ctrl+C, but they have equivalents within
  Microraptor's functionality).<br><br></li>

  <li><b>Robustness:</b> One of Microraptor's design goals was to
  allow clients (and even daemons in extreme situations) to leave and
  rejoin the Microraptor network without disrupting process execution.
  This is especially important when high-latency / low-reliability
  networks (i.e. wireless) are being used: if the wireless connection
  to the client goes away, you don't want your processes to die.  It's
  somewhat unclear to me how StartIt manages this; it looks like one
  of two things may be going on:
     <ol>
        <li> The 'Facilitator' launches all other processes.</li>
        <li> StartIt (which I believe is the GUI) launches other
        processes. </li>
     </ol>
  Since StartIt uses ssh for remote process launching, either case
  comes with its own perils, although the first option is somewhat
  better.  In the latter case, if you shut down the client, all of
  your processes will die.  In the former, if the network connection
  between the machine the Facilitator is running on and any other
  machine temporarily goes away, the ssh session will time out and
  your processes will be terminated.
  <br><br></li>

  <li><b>Multiple Clients:</b> I can't tell whether StartIt provides
  the ability for multiple clients to connect.  Microraptor allows an
  arbitrary number of clients to connect and monitor whichever
  processes each user is interested in; this is a boon when working in
  a team environment.<br><br></li>

  <li><b>Screen management:</b> StartIt uses significantly more screen
  real estate per process than Microraptor.  Whereas Microraptor has
  been easily used on projects involving more than 20 simultaneous
  processes (the current record is 55), as soon as you exceed six or
  so processes in StartIt you have to scroll back and forth to check
  on their status.  While processes can be hidden, this is cumbersome.
  In Microraptor, a tree view of machines and processes is available
  to allow you to view the status of all processes at a glance.

  In addition, it appears that StartIt uses a separate window to
  provide 'debug output' (stdout/stderr of the running processes).
  This means yet another window to manage, which bugs me. :-)  This is
  a personal preference, but Microraptor keeps everything organized in
  a single window.<br><br></li>

  <li><b>Commandline Management:</b> StartIt does provide the ability
  to generate rather nifty graphical interfaces to a process'
  commandline, at the cost of significant screen real estate.
  Microraptor has no such ability, instead only exposing the 'raw'
  commandline.  It's a neat feature, and on thinking about it, may be
  relatively straightforward to implement in Microraptor (although in
  the form of dialog windows, to conserve screen space).  Let us know
  if this is something you would really like to see happen. <br><br></li>

  <li><b>Alternate Interfaces:</b> As far as I can tell, StartIt
  provides only the one GUI.  In contrast, Microraptor supports a GUI
  ('claw'), a text-based interface ('mrterm'), and a C++ library suite
  allowing your processes to easily take advantage of Microraptor's
  process control features (libmrclient, libmrcommon, librcl).<br><br></li>

  <li><b>Portability:</b> StartIt is written in Java, and so should run
  anywhere a compatible JVM exists.  Microraptor's client ('claw') is
  written in GTK, and thus should be compilable on any architecture
  GTK supports.  However, to date we haven't had need for anything
  beyond Linux - contact us if you would like to see the client run on
  any other architecture, especially if you would be willing to do the
  porting. :-)  Microraptor's daemon (mraptord) also has only been
  used on Linux platforms, but should be portable to other *nix's.  We
  haven't investigated the feasibility of porting mraptord to Windows,
  and probably never will (at least not without a fair amount of
  incentive :-).<br><br></li>

  <li><b>Vitality:</b> I'm not sure of StartIt's current development /
  maintenance status, although the last release being in 2003 seems to
  point to possible abandonware.  I haven't spent any time verifying
  this, however.  Microraptor is being actively maintained and
  extended by Trey and myself; we both use it on a daily basis on a
  number of different large projects.<br><br></li>
</ul>

<h4> The Bottom Line </h4>

  <p class="content">StartIt wins in portability due to its use of
  Java, and is somewhat more graphically appealing for low numbers of
  processes (depending on your tastes).  However, Microraptor is
  significantly more flexible, easily supports many more processes,
  supports direct interaction with running processes, should be more
  robust, definitely supports multiple clients, and is definitely
  being actively maintained.</p>
