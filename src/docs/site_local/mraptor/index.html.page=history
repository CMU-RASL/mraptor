      <meta name="description" content="A brief account of the motivation
for and development of Microraptor.">
<h2>History</h2>

<p class="content">Microraptor is a remote process management system.
You run the Microraptor daemon on a remote host, then connect to it
with a local client.  Using the client, you can command the daemon to
run and kill processes, and communicate with each process's
stdin/stdout.</p>

<p class="content">Microraptor is a replacement for the Startup tool,
developed over several years at CMU.  Startup is similarly used for
process management.  Startup reads a config file with details about
each process, such as the command to run to start it, the host it
should run on, environment variable settings, etc.  It uses this
information to spawn one xterm window per process, and in each xterm,
a shell command is used to execute the process, either locally by
simple execution, or remotely via ssh.  Startup also has limited
support for killing processes, using the shell to invoke killall.</p>

<p class="content">The key flaw in the design of Startup is that the
xterms and the processes running within them maintain no connection to
the Startup program itself (Startup exits after spawning them).  This
leads to several problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Startup cannot detect when its processes exit.</li>

  <li>Startup xterms must be opened at the beginning of the run if the user
  wants to have access to process stdin/stdout.  They cannot be closed
  without killing the attached process.</li>
 
  <li>Startup doesn't know the pids of its processes, so it cannot kill them
  directly.  Instead, it uses the killall command provided by Linux, which
  has sometimes been unreliable.</li>

  <li>Startup has no way of managing the bandwidth between remote processes
  and the local host, since each process sends its output over a
  separate ssh connection.  Users will typically want to monitor only
  a few processes at a time, and different processes may be of interest
  at different times in the run.  When working over a low-bandwidth
  link, it is important to send only the data of interest.</li>

  <li>There is no way for multiple users on different machines to access
  the data from the same remote process.</li>
</ul>

<p class="content">Microraptor is designed to overcome all of these
problems.  The Microraptor GUI client (claw) can attach and detach
xterm-like windows from the stdin/stdout of processes managed by the
daemon.  Multiple clients can connect to the same daemon.  In short,
the great power and flexibility of Microraptor makes the writer of
Startup look like a real chump.  Read on to learn more about using
this wonderful system.</p>

<p class="content">Microraptor's first trial by fire was with the <a
href="http://palantir.swarthmore.edu/GRACE/">Grace project</a> during
the 2003 IJCAI/AAAI, held in Acapulco, Mexico.  While the entire
conference was fraught with disaster after disaster for the Grace
team, Microraptor did a creditable job, although it was very clearly
alpha software.</p>

<p class="content">While Grace helped us iron out many of the
Microraptor bugs, <a href="http://www.roboceptionist.com">Valerie</a>
proved to be the real challenge.  Val is a Roboceptionist at CMU's
Computer Science Department / Robotics Institute, and as such keeps
normal business hours.  Year round.  Needless to say, this constant
use turned up a few tricky ones, including the infamous (at least to
us) "defunct bug", which has since been fixed.  Courtesy Val and the
<a href="http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/atacama/">Life in the Atacama</a>
project, Microraptor has now been quite stable for some time.  There
are always bugs left in any software, but at least none have bit us
for a few months. :-)</a>

<p class="content">About the name Microraptor: recently (2003) a new
dinosaur species was discovered in China.  The new species has
feathers on all four limbs, suggesting it could glide between trees
like a flying squirrel.  This find is a key point in a long-standing
debate about how flight evolved in dinosaurs.  The species was named
Microraptor gui, in honor of Chinese paleontologist Gu Zhiwei.  The
rest is history.</p>

<p class="content">One note about referring to Microraptor: the name
was initially <i>MicroRAPTOR</i>, due to Trey's godawful <i>Micro
Remote Activator Process To Obliterate Rover</i> acronym.  These days,
the developers just refer to it as <i>Microraptor</i> (<b>not</b>
<i>MicroRaptor</i>), but more commonly use the <i>mraptor</i>
shorthand.  Right, so don't call it <i>MicroRAPTOR</i> or
<i>MicroRaptor</i>, 'cause it bugs Brennan for some reason.</p>
