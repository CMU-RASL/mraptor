# $Log: stress_test.config,v $
# Revision 1.5  2004/11/25 05:22:05  brennan
# *** empty log message ***
#
# Revision 1.4  2004/05/27 13:58:37  trey
# added support for stdout_wait_for_end_of_line (changed default behavior to *NOT* wait for end-of-line)
#
# Revision 1.3  2003/03/30 19:47:11  brennan
# Massive changes in the guts of claw.  In response to the performance
# problems observed in the field, we now only instantiate one
# ProcessWidget per process and reparent the widget back and forth
# between the tabs of the notebook.  This resulted in zero observable
# change from the user standpoint (besides an unquantified performance
# bump during high-output situations and a slowdown in tab switching
# (since the widget gets unrealized and realized during a tab switch)).
# This needs to be stress-tested badly.
#
# Moved kill option in right-click menu to the bottom.  This is
# non-intuitive in that it doesn't occupy the same slot as "run", but it
# should reduce accidental clickage.  QUESTION: Would people prefer that
# "run" also gets moved to the end?
#
# Ordinalized swallowed windows with duplicate names (added numerical suffixes)
#
# Revision 1.2  2003/03/18 21:55:40  trey

# added config for running central
#
# Revision 1.8  2003/03/11 01:52:36  trey

# added get_clock command and ability of daemons to connect to each other
#
# Revision 1.4  2003/03/09 22:29:46  trey
# made log file names unique (changed log_dir to log_file with template patterns), added ability to suppress stdout history lines already received by client
#
# Revision 1.3  2003/02/26 15:48:35  trey
# fixed problem with printConfigFile.perl needing to be in the same dir as the config file
#
# Revision 1.2  2003/02/26 05:08:45  trey
# streamlined config file format
#
# Revision 1.1  2003/02/24 22:09:21  trey
# fixed reading of perl config files
#
