<h2>Writing Process Configuration Files</h2>

<div class="content">The process configuration file is the meat (or,
err, delicious meat-like soy product if you're vegetarian ;-) of
configuring Microraptor.  It defines which processes will be run
where, with what arguments, in what environment, and with what
dependencies.  This is the file you will spend most of your
Microraptor configuration time on.</div>

<div class="content">A process config file is a textual representation
of an <a href="./index.html?page=docs.guts#rcl">RCL</a> structure; the
simplest form is merely a text file containing the RCL description of
the processes.  However, for any nontrivial system, there is a
significant amount of duplication between process configurations.  To
make process config files easier to maintain, when loading a config
the RCL library first checks for the shebang (<span
class="ic">#!</span>) construct at the beginning of the file; if it's
present, the config file is executed, and the file's output is used as
the desired configuration.  This allows the user to write a Perl,
shell, or any other sort of script which will output the final
configuration on stdout.  See <a href="#configScripts">below</a> for
more details.</div>

<div class="content">That make any sense?  Don't worry about it; we'll
ease into things.  In this section, we'll cover the following:</div>

<h4>The Basics</h4>

<div class="content">The basic process config file is the textual
representation of an <a href="./index.html?page=docs.guts#rcl">RCL</a>
expression.  The top-level struture is an anonymous hash, hence the
enclosing curly braces around the below example.</div>

<div class="content">This anonymous hash has two member elements: <span
class="ic">groups</span> and <span class="ic">processes</span>. The
<span class="ic">groups</span> element is written first by convention,
and consists of a vector of mappings from group names to
space-separated lists of processes.  In versions of Microraptor prior
to 1.1.0, the first element of a group list may be <span
class="ic">-p</span>, indicating that if the group is given the run
command, the processes should execute in parallel; you may see this
construct in older config files.  Beginning with 1.1.0, this is now
the default and only option, and need not be explicitly specified.
Serialization may be enforced only through the processes' <span
class="ic">depends</span> option.  <span class="ic">groups</span> may
be either a vector (e.g. enclosed in square brackets) or a hash
(e.g. enclosed in curly braces).  We recommend using a vector, since
it will preserve group order; this is important if you care what order
the groups are displayed in Claw's process tree.
</div>

<div class="content">Note that comments are Perl-style: they begin
with a hash mark ('#'), and continue to the next newline.  In Emacs
and other editors with syntax highlighting and indentation, a mode
compatible with Perl will work nicely with RCL.</div>

<div class="content">The <span class="ic">groups</span> definition
must be followed by a comma, after which the <span
class="ic">processes</span> element is defined (again, this may be
either a vector or a hash, as discussed above).  This element consists
of a comma-separated list of processes, with the Microraptor-name
(alias) for the process on the left of the <span class="ic">=></span>,
and the process configuration on the right.  The process configuration
is itself a hash, with 11 valid elements.  See the <a
href="./index.html?page=docs.daemon#processConfig">&lt;process_config&gt;</a>
documentation on the daemon doc page for details about the possible
elements of the individual process config hash.  The only required
element is the <span class="ic">cmd</span> entry, which specifies the
commandline to execute for this process.</div>

<div class="content">That's all there is to it!  There are many more
available options in the individual process config hashes, but they're
already explained in detail <a
href="./index.html?page=docs.daemon#processConfig">here</a>.</div>

<h5>Simple RCL configuration example</h5>

<div class="content">Very similar to the <a
href="./source/software/src/microraptor/daemon/simple.config">Simple</a>
example below; this is a heavily commented barebones example of an RCL
process configuration file:</div>

<pre class="indent">

{ # Begin anonymous top-level hash

    # Define groups as space-separated process lists; these are purely
    # for convenience.  Individual processes may be in multiple or no
    # groups.  If no groups are needed, merely define groups as the
    # empty vector:
    #   groups => [ ],
    # Note: you can use a hash (e.g. '{ }') instead, but the order of
    # the groups will not be preserved.  This only matters if you care
    # how the groups are ordered in Claw's process tree.
    groups => [
        all => "central a b c",
        init => "central",
        odd => "a c"
    ],

    # Define the processes themselves.  The process name on the left
    # need not correspond to the binary being run, although it's often
    # a good idea.
    processes => [

        # The only required element of the process hash is 'cmd',
        # which defines the commandline for this process
        central => { cmd="/home/line/projects/external/ipc-3.7.6/bin/Linux-2.4/central"},

        # We may also define an 'env' hash, which will add the given
        #   environment variables to the process' starting
        #   environment.  The default environment consists of the
        #   environment of the mraptord daemon; this is often modified
        #   through the prelaunchfile directive in /etc/mraptord.conf.
        # In addition, the ready string is used to determine when the
        #   process can be considered to be started for purposes of
        #   resolving dependencies.  Once the ready string appears
        #   anywhere in the process' output, the process moves from
        #   'starting' to 'running', and all processes dependent on it
        #   start.
	a => { cmd="./counter a", env={ COUNTER=xyz },
	       ready=": 2"},

        # The working directory may also be defined; a 'cd' will be
        #   executed to this directory before 'cmd' is executed.  Note
        #   that if your binary is in the working directoy, you will
        #   need to precede its name with a './', unless the current
        #   directory ('.') is in your path or the working_dir itself
        #   is in your path.
	b => { cmd="touch foo", working_dir=/tmp },

        # A file to log the process' output to may be set; if not set,
        #   the output is not logged.  %n will be replaced with the
        #   process name ('c' in this case), and %u will be replaced
        #   with a four-digit number guaranteed to make the filename
        #   unique.  A new log is started every time the command is
        #   executed.
        # The 'depends' vector may also be defined; when a process
        #   with dependencies is run, it is put in the pending state
        #   while all of its dependencies are run, and only starts
        #   execution once all processes it depends on have reached the
        #   running state.  The vector is a comma-separated,
        #   square-bracket-enclosed, list of quoted process names.
	c => { cmd="bc", log_file="/tmp/bc/%n_%u.log",
	       depends => ["a"] },

    ] # End processes vector (again, it could be a hash)

} # End anonymous top-level hash

<h4>Scripts as Process Config Files</h4>

<div class="content">For any system of reasonable size, maintaining
the process configuration file can quickly become a significant
chore.  To ease this, Microraptor supports scriptable configuration
files.  When loading a process configuration, the Microraptor programs
examine the first line for the shebang (<span class="ic">#!</span>)
construct: if it exists, the configuration file is executed, and its
output is used instead of the raw contents of the file.</div>

<div class="content">This allows you to make use of any scripting
language you would like, as long as it outputs valid RCL syntax, as
described above in <a href="#configBasics">The Basics</a>.  The
authors of Microraptor prefer Perl, and have provided a helper script
for this purpose (<a
href="./source/software/microraptor/daemon/printConfigFile.perl">printConfigFile.perl</a>,
which is installed in /usr/bin by the RPM).  If you choose to use a
language other than Perl, we would recommend porting
printConfigFile.perl, and would appreciate a copy for inclusion in
future releases.</div>

<div class="content">While your configuration script may take any
form, the basic structure we follow is to calculate any common or
derived values, define a default set of process configuration values,
define the actual configuration hash, and finally print it using the
<span class="ic">print_main</span> function provided by
printConfigFile.perl.  Below is a simple, but heavily commented, Perl
process configuration script.  A much more complex real-world example
is the <a
href="./source/software/src/microraptor/daemon/trestle.config">Trestle
project configuration</a>.</div>

# mrterm.

<a name="configMerging">
<h4>Merging Mechanism</h4>

<div class="content">Although we recommend for your sanity that you
maintain your entire system's configuration in one file, it is
possible to break it up into multiple files, or even overlay an
entirely new config on top of an old one.  Whenever multiple configs
are loaded, they are merged into one coherent whole, which is used by
all daemons.  This works well if there are no overlaps in the config
files (e.g. the same process is not defined twice).  If there are
overlaps, however, the conflicts must be resolved.</div>

<div class="content">Basically, overlapping entries from config files
loaded later overwrite entries from config files loaded earlier, in
order to maintain a consistent configuration system-wide. In the case
of poorly-written config files, this may result in a race condition
depending on when each config file is loaded; this is one of the
reasons we advocate a single config.  Also note that when you change a
process' config through Claw or mrterm (e.g. use the <a
href="./index.html?page=docs.daemon#set">set</a> command) what you are
effectively doing is loading a one-entry config file, which is merged
with the existing config to update the process in question.</div>

<div class="content"><b>Note:</b> Since conflicts are resolved at the
per-process level, there is currently no way to <i>remove</i> a
process from the loaded configuration without restarting
Microraptor.  This hasn't really bothered us, so we're unlikely to
address it unless asked nicely to do so. :-)</div>

<div class="content"><b>Note:</b> I've written this section
off-the-cuff, and it may be more-or-less correct, or completely off
base.  Trey, when you get a chance, correct me, eh?  Specifically,
I'm unsure of whether overlapping process entries are replaced
wholesale, or are individual fields merged? (e.g. if copy 1 of Process
Foo defines working_dir, but a loaded-later copy 2 of Process Foo does
not, is working_dir defined in the result?)</div>

<a name="configGotchas">
<h4>Gotchas</h4>

<p> There are a few subtleties to writing Microraptor config files
that are worth explicitly pointing out:

<ul>
  <li><div class="noindent">Because the configuration file is
  process-centric, it is not possible to define two processes with the
  same Microraptor-name, even if they're running on different
  machines/daemons.  Note that this does not mean you can't run the same
  binary twice: you just need to give it a different alias in your
  process configuration file, like this:</div>

<pre class="indent">
{
  groups => { },
  processes => {
    oil => { cmd="env", host="fubar" },
    toxicWaste => { cmd="env", host="barfu" }
  }
}
</pre>

  <div class="noindent"><span class="ic">oil</span> and <span
  class="ic">toxicWaste</span> will work just fine.  However, if you
  had instead defined two <span class="ic">env</span> processes:</div>

<pre class="indent">
{
  groups => { },
  processes => {
    # BAD!
    env => { cmd="env", host="fubar" },
    env => { cmd="env", host="barfu" }
  }
}
</pre>

  <div class="noindent">...you would not see your desired behavior.
  Instead, while parsing the configuration file, Microraptor would <a
  href="#configMerging">merge</a> the latter definition with the
  former, resulting in a single <span class="ic">env</span> process
  running on host <span class="ic">barfu</span>.</div>

  </li>

  <li><div class="noindent">The current working directory ('.') is often
  not in your path; thus, if you set the working_dir of a process to
  the directory its binary is contained in, your <span
  class="ic">cmd</span> must be preceded by a './'.  While you can add
  '.' to your path (for instance, in the prelaunchfile specified in <a
  href="./source/software/src/microraptor/scripts/mraptord.rpm.conf.txt">/etc/mraptord.conf</a>),
  we recommend against doing so, as it can cause strange problems down
  the road.</div></li>

  <li><div class="noindent">Ready strings are case- and space-sensitive:
  if a process never moves from <span class="ic">starting</span> to
  <span class="ic">running</span>, ensure that your ready string
  actually corresponds to your process' output.  Beware last minute
  typo-fixes to your processes' outputs! :-)</div></li>

  <li><div class="noindent">Members of a group <b>used to be</b>
  implicitly serialized, so if you have:</div>

<pre>groups => [ foo => "bar baz"],
processes => [ bar => { depends => ["baz"] }, baz => {}]
  (rest of process config omitted for clarity)
</pre>

  <div class="noindent">then running the foo group will result in a
  dependency cycle if you are running a version older than 1.1.0.
  Beginning with 1.1.0, groups are implicitly run in parallel.  To
  make bug-squashing easier, there is no option to achieve the old
  serialize-all-members-of-a-group functionality; this can be achieved
  through proper use of the processes' <span class="ic">depends</span>
  configuration in a much more flexible manner.  If serialization of
  groups is particularly important to you, please <a
  href="./index.html?page=contact">contact us</a>, and we'll consider
  adding it back in, although to be honest we'll probably just suggest
  the use of appropriate <span class="ic">depends</span> clauses.</div>
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<a name="configDebugger">
<h4>Running Processes Under a Debugger</h4>

<div class="content">Microraptor can run processes under gdb.  In the
config for each process, there is an optional field 'debugger'.  Set its
value to 'gdb' (or the full path to the gdb binary) to run the process
under gdb.  No other debuggers are supported.</div>

<div class="content">Considerations:</div>

<ul>
<li><p class="content">The binary specified in the 'cmd' field for the process
     must be a valid absolute or
  relative filename, <i>without</i> relying on the executable path.</p></li>

<li><p class="content">When you run a process that is configured to use the debugger,
  mraptord starts the debugger but <i>does not</i> issue the 'run' command to
  gdb to start the process itself.  This is so that you can
  give preliminary commands to gdb before the process is executed.  For example,
  you can set up breakpoints before execution.</p></li>

<li><p class="content">In order to begin execution under gdb, you have two alternatives.
  First, you can issue the 'run' command to gdb manually through the stdin
  interface in claw or mrterm.  Second, you
  can prepend the 'run' command to the list of commands in the
  'stdin_commands' field of the process config to start the process
  automatically.</p></li>

<li><p class="content">However you run the process, you do <i>not</i> need to specify command-line
  arguments for gdb to pass on--you can use 'run' instead of <span class="ic">'run arg1
  arg2'</span>.  This is because mraptord automatically sets the command-line
  arguments for gdb to pass to the process using the gdb 'set
  args' command.  For example, if the 'cmd' field of the process config
  is set to <span class="ic">'mybinary arg1 arg2'</span>, then mraptord will send the command
  <span class="ic">'set args arg1 arg2'</span> to gdb stdin.  This happens before any commands
  in 'stdin_commands' are issued.</p></li>

<li><p class="content">While debugging, you may want to send an interrupt to the process to
  return control to gdb.  If you are using mrterm, this can be done
  using the daemon command <span class="ic">'signal INT &lt;process_name&gt;'</span> (which properly
  signals the process under gdb rather than gdb itself).  In
  the future you may be able to type ctrl-C in the process stdin widget
  in claw to send an interrupt.</p></li>

<li><p class="content">A note on implementation, which might be helpful for tracking down mraptord
  problems: When you run a process under a debugger, mraptord creates a
  temporary symlink (named e.g. "/tmp/mrlinkULxKNv") to the process
  binary specified in the 'cmd' field.  This is so that signals can be
  sent to the process later using the 'killall' command with
  the temporary symlink as a unique process name.  Mraptord should
  automatically delete the symlink when the process exits.</p></li>
</ul>
