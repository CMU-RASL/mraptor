<h2>Troubleshooting / Common Mistakes</h2>

<p>In other words, a FAQ.  Please <a
href="./index.html?page=contact">contact us</a> if you have questions
about Microraptor, or have a problem and solution you think would be
helpful to others.  For processs configuration file-related questions,
see the <a

of the <a href="./index.html?page=docs.config">Config</a> page.</p>

   <li><p class="noindent">Microraptor insists that my program isn't
   here, but I'm sure I have the working directory right!  What's
   going on?</p>

   <p class="noindent">Your (mraptord's) path likely does not include
   the current directory (i.e. ".").  Check this by changing one of
   your programs' commandlines to <i>env</i>, and look at the PATH
   variable in the output.  The fix is to prepend "./" to your
   executable's name in your config file, or change the file pointed
   to by mraptord's prelaunchfile directive (in /etc/mraptord.conf) to
   include "." in your path.  We recommend the former: including the
   cwd in your path often results in difficult-to-track-down problems
   months down the road when you've forgotten you made the change.</p>

   <li><p class="noindent">I killed a process, but it won't die!  When
   I login to the offending machine and run 'ps auxww', the process is
   listed as &lt;defunct&gt;.  What gives?</p>

   <p class="noindent">We believe this bug has been fixed beginning
   version 1.1.1.  If you observe these symptoms when using a version
   of Microraptor >= 1.1.1, please report the bug to us, with as much
   detail as possible.  Restarting the offending mraptord should
   temporarily resolve the problem.</p>
   </li>

   <li><p class="noindent">I started mraptord by hand to test things
   out, but it's just printing out a never-ending series of
   dots/periods/'.'s.  What the heck?</p>

   <p class="noindent">mraptord isn't connecting to central properly:
   if you're not using our startup scripts, it will use the default
   IPC port (1381).</p>

   <p class="noindent">If you installed the RPM, you should have an
   /etc/init.d/mraptord entry - if you start up mraptord and central
   via it (<i>/etc/init.d/mraptord start</i>), it should all Just Work
   (be sure to edit /etc/mraptord.conf first; see the <a
   href="./index.html?page=docs.config">config page</a>).  Use chkconfig if
   you'd rather not have mraptord start on boot (for better or worse,
   the default setup).

   <p class="noindent">If you'd rather just run everything by hand for
   now, you need to either set CENTRALHOST to localhost:1382 in the
   mraptord shell (or somewhere else if central isn't running on the
   same machine as mraptord, obviously) or pass mraptord a
   '--centralhost localhost:1382' argument.</p>

   <p class="noindent">Alternatively, just run central on 1381, and
   it'll all run out of the box w/o arguments.  Sharing a central
   between mraptor and your system is discouraged, however, since if
   your system loads central or you need to restart it (i.e.  because
   message definitions have changed), you also must restart the
   mraptord net.</p>

   <li><p class="noindent">I'm trying to run claw from a remote
   machine by <i>ssh -X</i>'ing in, then running claw.  However, I get
   an error something like:
<div class="ic">
Gdk-ERROR **: BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)<br>
  serial 23964 error_code 3 request_code 38 minor_code 0<br>
Gdk-ERROR **: BadAccess (attempt to access private resource denied)<br>
  serial 23965 error_code 10 request_code 102 minor_code 0<br>
</div></p>

   <p class="noindent">What gives?</p>

   <p class="noindent">I haven't done the digging to figure out
   <i>exactly</i> what's going on, but it has something to do with
   mismatches in X servers or something similar.  The fix is to <i>ssh
   -Y</i>, or set the <i>ForwardX11Trusted=yes</i> key in your
   ssh_conf. <i>Thanks to Rachel Gockley for finding the 'ssh -Y' workaround!</i></p>

<li><p class="noindent">How do I restart mraptord?</p>
     
<p class="noindent">This is covered in detail on the <a
href="./index.html?page=docs.config.mraptord">config page</a>.  In
short, for an RPM-installed mraptord: </p>

<div class="ic">
<b>To start:</b> /etc/init.d/mraptord start<br>
<b>To stop:</b> /etc/init.d/mraptord stop<br>
</div></li>
