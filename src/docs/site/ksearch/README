INSTALLATION:

You will need a text editor, and access to your server to edit and run
scripts. Be sure that the appropriate permissions are set for each
file/directory.

package includes	file name			set permissions
indexer script:		indexer.pl			read/exec
main search window:	search.html			read
search (top frame):	searchtopframe.html		read
help page:		help.html			read
reload page:		searchalt.html			read
style sheet (CSS):	style.css			read
configuration file:	configuration/configuration.pl	read
ignore files list:	configuration/ignore_files.txt	read
stop terms list:	configuration/stop_terms.txt	read

(For Unix users)	(type at command line)		(type 'ls -l' for file list)
read/exec		'chmod 755 filename'		-rwxr-xr-x
read			'chmod 744 filename'		-rwxr--r--


1. (For Unix users) Be sure that the path to perl is correct on the first line
of indexer.pl. To determine the path type 'which perl' at the command line prompt. 
The path must follow '#!'. Default is '#!/usr/bin/perl'.

2. Change paramaters in the configuration file
'configuration/configuration.pl'.  All paramaters are explained in this file.

3. Add the full path of files you do not want to index in the ignore files
list 'configuration/ignore_files.txt' on separate lines.
(For Unix users) You can determine your current working directory (path) by
typing 'pwd' at the command line prompt.

4. Add terms you do not want indexed in the stop terms list
'configuration/stop_terms.txt' on separate lines.

5. You may change the HTML in "help.html", "searchalt.html" and at the end of 
"searchtopframe.html" (after embedded JavaScript) to match your design preferences. 
You may also change the cascading style sheet "style.css" to match your design 
preferences.

6. When you are finished with the configuration you can run the indexer
script to index your site. Type 'indexer.pl' or './indexer.pl' to run the
script. The time required will depend on the size of your site and your
server's CPU.

7. When you are finished indexing your site, you can open "search.html" to 
search your site.
