<meta name="description" content="Configuring Microraptor's GTK
client, claw.">
<h2>Configuring claw</h2>

<div class="content">There are two classes of configuration options
with claw: commandline options, and local preferences.  Commandline
options (as well as how to invoke claw) are covered on <a
href="./index.html?page=docs.claw">claw's documentation page</a>;
we'll cover local preferences here.</div>

<div class="content">Claw's preferences dialog may be accessed by
pressing <span class="ic">Ctrl+P</span> or through the <span
class="ic">Main->Set Local Preferences...</span> menu.  The available
options are:</div>

<ul>
  <li><b>View mode:</b> (Legal values: <span class="ic">daemons</span>
  or <span class="ic">groups</span>; Default: <span class="ic">daemons</span>)<br>
      <div class="content">The view mode determines the ordering and
      default expansion of the process tree on the left side of Claw.
      If set to <span class="ic">daemons</span>, the daemon-rooted
      process trees will be displayed first, and will be automatically
      expanded.  This makes the most sense if organizing processes by
      machine/daemon is logical for your project.</div>

      <div class="content">If set to <span class="ic">groups</span>,
      the process groups defined in the process configuration file
      will instead be listed first, and will be automatically
      expanded.  If you prefer to group your processes into
      (potentially cross-machine) chunks, this will work better for
      you.</div>
  </li>

  <a name="tieSelToTab">
  <li><b>Tie selection to tab:</b> (Legal values: <span
  class="ic">0</span> or <span class="ic">1</span>; Default: <span class="ic">1</span>)<br>
      <div class="content">If 1, the currently selected process in the
      process tree will change if you select a different process'
      output in the tabbed window on the right.  If 0, changes to the
      current tab do not affect the selection in the process tree.
      This is relevant because many of the keyboard shortcuts use the
      current process tree selection.</div>
  </li>

  <li><b>Groups select members:</b> (Legal values: <span
  class="ic">0</span> or <span class="ic">1</span>; Default: <span class="ic">0</span>)<br>
      <div class="content">If 1, when a group view tab is selected,
      all processes in the group will be selected in the process tree.
      If 0, the group entry will be selected, instead of the component
      processes.  Again, this is relevant because many of the keyboard
      shortcuts use the current process tree selection.</div>
  </li>

  <li><b>Display skew:</b> (Legal values: <span
  class="ic">0</span> or <span class="ic">1</span>; Default: <span class="ic">0</span>)<br>
      <div class="content">If 1, display the time skew (if any)
      between each daemon and the client.  This will be displayed in
      the Status column of the process tree, in seconds.</div>
  </li>

  <li><b>Back history length:</b> (Legal values: any non-negative
  integer; Default: 100)<br>
      <div class="content">The setting for this option determines how
      many lines of a process' output will be displayed when the
      process is first viewed.  Setting this too high will slow the
      client down when viewing new processes; setting it too low will
      deny the user much-needed context.</div>
      <div class="content"><b>Note:</b> While writing this, it was
      noted that this setting may not be having any effect; I'm
      looking into it.</div>
  </li>

  <li><b>Cool graphics:</b> (Legal values: <span
  class="ic">0</span> or <span class="ic">1</span>; Default: <span class="ic">0</span>)<br>
      <div class="content">If 1, gratuitous graphics are displayed in
      the bottom portion of the process tree.  The graphics change
      from the default whenever an error is logged to the common
      buffer (the buffer spanning the bottom of Claw's window).</div>

      <div class="content"><b>Note:</b> Due to a bug in gcc, building
      the XPM graphics files for these graphics takes an extremely
      long time with gcc 3.1 and 3.2.  Thus, if your RPM was built
      with an affected gcc, the graphics are not included.  If you
      wish to build with graphics, grab the source and <span
      class="ic">#undef NO_BIG_XPMS</span> after the first <span
      class="ic">#ifndef</span> block at the top of <a
      href="./source/software/src/microraptor/client/imageHeaders.h">imageHeaders.h</a>
      (or just delete the first <span class="ic">#ifndef</span> block
      entirely) before building.</div>
  </li>

  <li><b>Clear on run:</b> (Legal values: <span
  class="ic">0</span> or <span class="ic">1</span>; Default: <span class="ic">1</span>)<br>
      <div class="content">If 1, clear a process' display when a run
      command is issued.  If 0, keep the output from the previous run
      in the buffer and append the output from the new run</div>
  </li>

  <li><b>SSH displays:</b> (Legal values: hash of daemon names to ssh
  display tunnel; Default: <span class="ic">{}</span><br>
      <div class="content">Set a hash of daemon name to the SSH
      display tunnel to be used for processes with a DISPLAY setting
      of <span class="ic">%c</span>.  See the <a
      href="source/software/src/microraptor/docs/ssh_tunnelling.txt">SSH
      Tunnelling Howto</a>; setting this hash substitutes for the
      <span class="ic">--ssh-display</span> commandline option.</div>
  </li>

  <li><b>Default config width:</b> (Legal values: <span
  class="ic">integers greater than 0</span>; Default: <span class="ic">800</span>)<br>
      <div class="content">The default width, in pixels, for the
      process configuration windows (e.g. the dialogs that appear when
      "set config" is selected).  Longer is better for projects with
      long commandlines; shorter is more compact.</div>
  </li>

  <li><b>Stdout filtering:</b> (Legal values: <span
  class="ic">0</span> or <span class="ic">1</span>; Default: <span class="ic">0</span>)<br>
      <div class="content">If 1, include a filter entry to the right
      of the stdin entry for each process.  This allows you to use
      POSIX regexps to filter what lines are displayed.  While this
      may appear esoteric, it's rather handy when working with
      log-happy processes. </div>
  </li>

</ul>

<div class="content">After configuring Claw's preferences to your
liking, you may save them via the <span class="ic">Main->Save local
preferences to file...</span> menu item.  The default location is
<span class="ic">~/.claw.prefs</span>; this is recommended, as it will
be loaded automatically on startup.  If you save it elsewhere, you
will need to either specify the <span class="ic">-p</span> option when
running claw or manually load the config through the <span
class="ic">Main->Load local preferences from file...</span> menu
option.</div>
