<h2>Configuring mraptord</h2>

<div class="content">mraptord doesn't require much direct
configuration, since most information is stored in the process config
file loaded at daemon start or loaded by a client at some later
point.  However, there are a number of choices to be made about how
and where to start the daemon (mraptord).  These vary depending on
whether you installed from an RPM (and thus have a SysV startup system
already in place), or built from source.  See below for help on:</div>

<h4>Configuring an RPM Installation</h4>

<div class="content">If you installed the <i>mraptor-server</i> RPM ,
mraptord is already set up in your SysV (/etc/rc.d and /etc/init.d)
startup system, and will come up on boot.  If you would prefer that it
not start on boot, simply <span class="ic">chkconfig mraptord
off</span> as root.  Regardless, you may start or stop mraptord by
running <span class="ic">/etc/init.d/mraptord start</span> or <span
class="ic">/etc/init.d/mraptord stop</span>.  Note that after
installation mraptord has not been started; you will need to do so by
hand (or reboot) after configuring /etc/mraptord.conf:</div>

<div class="content">The behavior of the /etc/init.d/mraptord script
is controlled by the contents of <a
href="./source/software/src/microraptor/scripts/mraptord.rpm.conf.txt">/etc/mraptord.conf</a>.
Within mraptord.conf, you may set:</div>

<ul>
  <li>(Optional) The path to IPC's central (defaults to
  /usr/bin/central, which is where the <a
  href="./index.html?page=download#ipc">IPC RPM</a> installs it)</li>
  <li>The path to the mraptord binary (you will never need to change
  this if you installed from an RPM)</li>
  <li>(Optional) The path to a process configuration file to load on
  startup</li>
  <li> The daemon's stance: one of 'primary' or 'secondary'. 'primary'
  implies that central should be launched on this machine and the
  specified process configuration file should be loaded.  If 'primary'
  is set, the path to central and the path to a configuration file are
  no longer optional. A setting of 'secondary' results in launching only the daemon.</li>
  <li> The host and port of IPC's central</li>
  <li> The user to run mraptord as</li>
  <li> A file to source within bash before launching mraptord; usually
  used to set up environment variables common to all processes.</li>
</ul>

<div class="content">The file itself contains extensive documentation
of the options; see the <a
href="./source/software/src/microraptor/scripts/mraptord.rpm.conf.txt">current
CVS version</a> for an example.</div>

<div class="content">Once you've finished configuration, start the
daemon by running <span class="ic">/etc/init.d/mraptord start</span>
as root.  Examine /tmp/mraptordLog to see if there were any problems
starting up.</div>

<a name="mraptordBoot">
<h4>Running a non-RPM mraptord on Boot</h4>

<p>So, you built from source, and want mraptord to come up on boot,
eh?  You can always install mraptord into the SysV setup by hand, if
you'd like:</p>

<ol>
  <li><div>Copy <a
  href="./source/software/src/microraptor/scripts/mraptord.rpm.sysv.txt">scripts/mraptord.rpm.sysv</a>
  to /etc/init.d/mraptord.</div></li>
  <li>Ensure that it's executable: <span class="ic">chmod a+rx
  /etc/init.d/mraptord</span></li>
  <li>Install it into the rc.d diretories: <span
  class="ic">/sbin/chkconfig --add mraptord</span></li>
  <li><div>Copy the <a
  href="./source/software/src/microraptor/scripts/mraptord.rpm.conf.txt">scripts/mraptord.rpm.conf</a>
  file to /etc/mraptord.conf, and configure as detailed <a
  href="#rpmConfig">above</a></div></li>
</ol>

<p>Alternatively, the quick and dirty approach is to just add mraptord
to rc.local, which is run after all other system startup tasks are
completed:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>We will run a copy of IPC's central on the nonstandard port 1382 for
all mraptord-claw communications, leaving port 1381 free for the users
to run their own central.  It is desirable to not have mraptord and
user traffic over the same central to allow the users flexibility in
restarting "their" central without killing the microraptor system.</p>

<p>Assuming that /etc/rc.local is a tcsh script, add these lines to
the machine that will run central (the "primary" mraptor machine),
with the obvious substitutions (when cutting and pasting, beware: your
browser may break some lines to make them fit):</p>

<div class="ic">
# -lx -u ensures central doesn't block on input or output via stdin/stdout<br>
set path = (. $path)<br>
sudo -H -u mraptor_user -c "/path/to/IPC/bin/central -s -lx -u -p1382 >& /dev/null &"<br>
sudo -H -u mraptor_user -c "/path/to/mraptord --centralhost localhost:1382 -c /path/to/config/file/my.config  >& /dev/null &"<br>
</div>

<p>On all other daemon machines, add the following to /etc/rc.local,
again with the obvious substitutions:</p>

<div class="ic">
set path = (. $path)
sudo -H -u mraptor_user -c "/path/to/mraptord --centralhost centralhostname:1382 >& /dev/null &"
</div>

<p>You <i>can</i> load a config file on startup for more than one
daemon, but for your sanity a single centralized config is highly
recommended (it doesn't necessarily have to be on the machine where
central is running).  Additional config files will be merged in using
Microraptor's merging mechanism (which will be explained in detail <a
href="#configMerging">below</a> once we write that section).
Basically, overlapping entries from config files loaded later
overwrite entries from config files loaded earlier, in order to
maintain a consistent configuration system-wide.</p>

</div>

<a name="mrapRestart">
<h4>Configuring mraptord to Automatically Restart</h4>

<div class="content">In general, there's no need to restart mraptord
during normal operations, and the default SysV installation works just
fine.  However, on occasion you will want to restart the entire daemon
network, usually as a result of either an mraptord bug or a desire to
reset the process config file (recall that additional configs are
merged into the existing loaded config, so there's no way to remove a
process entry at runtime).  Bringing the daemon network down is
trivial: an <span class="ic">/etc/init.d/mraptord stop</span> on the
primary machine will shut down the central being used by all the
daemons, and cause them to kill their child processes and quit.
However, getting all the daemons back up again is a bit of a pain: you
need to ssh to each of the machines in the network to manually start
the daemon.</div>

<div class="content">Enter <a
href="./source/software/src/microraptor/scripts/mrapstarter">mrapstarter</a>!
mrapstarter is a ridiculously simple bash script run via cron which
just checks if mraptord is running; if not, it attempts to start it.
Thus, you may stop the entire network via a <span
class="ic">/etc/init.d/mraptord stop</span> on the primary machine,
make your changes, and simply restart the primary daemon (<span
class="ic">/etc/init.d/mraptord start</span>).  All the secondary
daemons will start up automatically within a minute.
As of 1.1.2, mrapstarter is not included in the RPM, but I'll add it
once the CVS server gets back from Chile. :-)  For now, install it
thusly on all secondary daemon machines:</div>

<ol>
  <li> Download it
  <a href="./source/software/src/microraptor/scripts/mrapstarter">here</a></li>
  <li> Drop it in /usr/bin</li>
  <li> Ensure that it is executable (<span class="ic">chmod a+rx
  /usr/bin/mrapstarter</span>) </li>
  <li> Run it once a minute via cron (add the line <span class="ic">*
  * * * * root mrapstarter</span> to /etc/crontab) </li>
</ol>
