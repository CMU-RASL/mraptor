Microraptor from binary RPMs.">
<h2>RPM Installation</h2>

<p>Installing Microraptor is just like installing any other RPM.  It
doesn't depend on any other packages, although a copy of <a
href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ipc/">IPC's central</a> is needed on one
of the machines which will be running the Microraptor daemon.  You can
either install from the official tarball, or use our unofficial <a
    href="./index.html?page=download#ipc">IPC RPM</a>.

<ol>
   <li class="spaced">Get the RPM(s) appropriate for your system and
   needs from the <a href="./index.html?page=download">downloads
   page</a>.  RPMs appropriate for the systems we (the developers) use
   on a regular basis and/or have easy access to will be maintained
   there; RPMs for all other systems will posted as they're provided
   to us.  There are five RPMs available:
      <ul>
          <li><b>mraptor-server</b>: The mraptord server.  Install
          this on any machine that you wish to control processes via
          Microraptor.</li>
          <li><b>mraptor-claw</b>: The GTK-based client.</li>
          <li><b>mraptor-mrterm</b>: The limited text-based client.
          If possible, stick with claw - it's easier to use and has
          more functionality, although mrterm has its purposes.</li>
          <li><b>mraptor-util</b>: An unsupported set of
          mraptor-related utilities.  Use at your own risk.</li>
          <li><b>mraptor-dev</b>: The headers and libraries needed to
          programatically interface with the mraptor stysm.</li>
      </ul>
   </li>

   <li class="spaced">If you've previously installed a mraptor RPM
   from release 1.1.2 or earlier, save the config file and uninstall
   it:
       <pre>cp /etc/mraptord.conf /etc/mraptord.conf.old
rpm -ev mraptor mraptor-server</pre>
   If you won't be installing <i>mraptor-server</i>, there's no need
   to save /etc/mraptord.conf.</li>

   <li class="spaced">As root, install the RPM(s):
       <pre>rpm -Uvh mraptor-&lt;component name&gt;-&lt;version number&gt;.rpm</pre>
       If installing on a CMU-CS Facilitized machine, you'll likely
       need to use the --nodeps option if rpm complains about missing
       libgcc dependencies.  The gcc3 compiler is installed in
       /usr/local, and *isn't* tied into the RPM system.  Quite
       annoying - it breaks the dependencies, but will run just fine
       if you force it to install.
   </li>
   <li> If you've installed <i>mraptor-server</i>:
        <ol>
           <li class="spaced">Configure the daemon, and write a config file for your
                 processes: see the <a
                 href="./index.html?page=docs.config">configuration
                 page</a>.  The short version is:
                 <ul>
                     <li> Write a config, following <a
                                  href="/source/software/src/microraptor/daemon/example.config">this example</a>.</li>
                     <li> Modify /etc/mraptord.conf (<a
        href="/source/software/src/microraptor/scripts/mraptord.rpm.conf">example</a>) to point to your config file and copy of IPC's <i>central</i>.</li>
                 </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="spaced">Start up mraptord on every daemon machine as
                 root (this will now happen automatically on boot):
                 <pre>/etc/init.d/mraptord start</pre></li>
        </ol>
   </li>

   <li class="spaced"> If you backed up /etc/mraptord.conf earlier,
   and you just installed <i>mraptor-server</i>, restore your config
   by either transcribing your settings into the new file by hand or
   copying the old file over it wholesale:
   <pre>mv /etc/mraptord.conf.old /etc/mraptord.conf</pre></li>

   <li class="spaced"> If you've installed <i>mraptor-server</i>, but
   don't want the daemon to automatically start up on this machine,
   just <span class="ic">su; chkconfig mraptord off</span>.</li>

   <li class="spaced">Run <a href="./index.html?page=docs.claw">claw</a> or <a
   href="./index.html?page=docs.mrterm">mrterm</a> with the
   appropriate CENTRALHOST settings to connect to the daemon.</li>
   <li>Go wild!</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Only install <i>mraptor-server</i> on machines that you'll actually
be using it on.  Due to its nature, it does constitute a security
risk, and should not be frivolously installed.</p>
