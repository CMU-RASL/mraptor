<p class="content">Although we were unable to find any software that
fulfilled our needs when Microraptor development began, we have since
become aware of some packages that fill a somewhat similar niche. As
we discover or are told of such software, we will list it here, with a
brief pros and cons review.  As our time is rather limited, these
reviews will be of necessity brief, cursory, and based solely upon
available documentation; if you feel we're in error, please let us
know, and we'll happily correct ourselves.  In no way do we mean to
denigrate the work of others; our goal is merely to point out the
differences between Microraptor and the other available options, in
order to allow the user to make an informed decision.</p>
