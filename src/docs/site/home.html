<meta name="description" content="Overview of Microraptor's features.">

<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p class="content">Welcome to the home of Microraptor: a robust,
distributed process management system!  Microraptor's purpose is to
provide reliable, flexible, and scalable process control for a
development or deployment team working with many processes spread
across an arbitrary number of computers.  While initially created at
the <a href="http://www.ri.cmu.edu/">Robotics Institute</a> of <a
href="http://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a> to ease
development and deployment of software for field and team robotics,
Microraptor more generally supports process management
in distributed systems.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<ul>
 <li><b>Manage processes</b> across multiple machines</li>
 <li><b>Monitor status</b> of all processes at a glance</li>
 <li><b>Interact</b> with process consoles:
 <ul>
   <li>Tabbed windows manage clutter when there are many processes</li>
   <li>Can subscribe/unsubscribe to process console output dynamically,
   which helps manage bandwidth when processes are running on a
   remote host with a low-bandwidth connection</li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li><b>Configure</b> how to run processes using a flexible config file format</li>
 <li><b>Multiple users</b> can view/manage the same processes:
 <ul>
   <li>User interface clients
      can be dynamically started, killed, or disconnected from the network without
      affecting managed processes</li>
   <li>Clients and daemons automatically synchronize their configuration, so
   a configuration file only needs to be loaded once</li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 
 <li><b>Process dependencies</b> can be specified:
 <ul>
   <li>Detection of when a process is "ready" based on its console output</li>
   <li>Running process Y will result in all processes Y depends on
   automatically running, with Y only running when all depended-upon
   processes are "ready"</li>
   <li>Dependency links can span processes on multiple hosts</li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li><b>Log</b> process console output to process-local disk, independent of
 whether it's being observed at runtime</li>
 <li><b>Easily installed</b> on systems which support RPMs and a
 SysV-style startup system (such as RedHat), as well as apt-based
 Linux distributions (such as Ubuntu), Microraptor is installed
 and configured as a daemon 'out of the box'.  A Microraptor network
 can be established from scratch in under half an hour; most of that
 time is needed to write the configuration file.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p class="content">A Microraptor system includes one or many host
computers that can play different roles.  Some hosts (e.g. embedded
computers onboard robots) run managed processes; each of those hosts
must be able to run mraptord (the Microraptor daemon).  Other hosts
(e.g. user laptops) run one of the Microraptor clients (claw or
mrterm) to allow the user to command and monitor managed processes.
If you like, a single host computer can run both daemon and clients.
In addition, a single Microraptor network may contain host computers
running different operating systems.</p>

<p class="content">Basic platform requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <div class="content"><b><a href="index.html?page=docs.daemon">mraptord</a></b>
       - Primarily developed for Linux, also ported to Windows
       running under <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>.  mraptord
       has been used successfully with long uptimes on both
       platforms, but some of the advanced features are untested under Cygwin.</div></li>
  <li> <div class="content"><b><a href="index.html?page=docs.claw">claw</a>
       graphical client</b>
       - Currently runs only under Linux, but still works on older
       distributions going back to RedHat 7.2.</div>

       <div class="content">Because claw is an X windows application,
       in a pinch you can also run claw on a remote Linux host and send
       the display to your Windows or Mac OS X host if it runs an X server.
       </div>

       <div class="content">We hope to develop an improved graphical
       client that will also run natively under Mac OS X, stay tuned.</div></li>
  <li> <div class="content"><b><a href="index.html?page=docs.mrterm">mrterm</a>
       console client</b> - like mraptord, mrterm runs under Linux and Windows/Cygwin.
       It is also easy to run remotely under ssh.
       You can use mrterm as your primary client in a pinch, but for day-to-day
       use you will want to have a graphical client available.
       </div></li>
</ul>

<h3>Support</h3>

<p class="content">Please note that while the developers of
Microraptor (Trey Smith and Brennan Sellner) are more than happy to
provide access to the source code and the RPMs we build, we are both
full-time graduate students at the RI, and do not have the resources
to provide technical support.  Please feel free to <a
href="./index.html?page=contact">contact us</a>, but be advised that
we may not have time to give you the level of assistance we would like
to.</p>

<!-- A LEGAL NOTE WOULD BE NICE: CAN WE GPL THIS? -->
