<meta name="description" content="How to install Microraptor.">
<h2>Installation Overview</h2>

<p> As with anything, there are a number of ways to install
Microraptor: RPM, SRPM, and build from source.  We recommend them in
precisely that order: if an RPM is available for your system, use the
sucker.  If not, try building a binary RPM from the SRPM (see <a
href="./index.html?page=docs.install.srpm">instructions</a>).  If
you're successful, please drop us a copy to save others the work.  If
RPMs just don't do it for you, build from the source using <a
href="./index.html?page=docs.install.source">these instructions</a>,
although be warned: it can be a bit hairy.  If you would like to
contribute a package for your distribution, we would be eternally
grateful.</p>

<p> Regardless, you need a working IPC installation before installing
Microraptor.  We provide unofficial RPMs of the latest version of IPC
<a href="./index.html?page=download#ipc">here</a>.  If you prefer to
obtain it straight from the source, go to <a
href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ipc">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ipc</a> for
the latest version of IPC.  It's relatively easy to build, so don't
worry about it too much. :-) </p>

<p> Once you've installed Microraptor, continue on to the <a
