<h2>The Microraptor Libraries</h2>

<div class="content">In addition to providing the daemon, a text-based
client, and a graphical client, the Microraptor distribution includes
C++ libraries to allow the user to build Microraptor process control
into their own processes.  In fact, there's no reason a process under
Microraptor control cannot itself use the Microraptor libraries to
control other processes.  If you feel so inclined, this can even
provide a rather... baroque alternative to exit(). ;-)</div>

<div class="content">As of 1.1.0, the libraries and relevant headers
are included in the RPM.  Three libraries are included: <span
class="ic">libmrclient.a, libmrcommon.a,</span> and <span
class="ic">librcl.a</span>, along with associated headers.  If
installed via RPM, the libraries are installed to <span
class="ic">/usr/lib</span>, while the headers reside in <span
class="ic">/usr/include/mraptor</span>.  If you built from source, the
libraries were compiled to the /lib/<OS-VERSION> subdirectory of your
build directory; the headers are scattered throughout the source tree.
Note that you'll also need libipc.a, from the <a
href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ipc">IPC distribution</a>.</div>

<div class="content">As a rule, just link against all three libraries,
and include headers as necessary.  An example of their usage can be
found in the mrapMonitor utility, whose code resides in <a
href="./source/software/src/microraptor/utils/mrapMonitor.cc">utils/mrapMonitor.cc</a>.
mrapMonitor is a (so far undocumented) utility, whose purpose is to
monitor the status of a specified subset of Microraptor-controlled
processes, and execute a specified script when they enter different
states.  It's used in the <a
href="http://www.roboceptionist.com">Roboceptionist</a> project to
send email to the current maintainers if a process crashes.
mrapMonitor is also a decent example of using RCL in your own code for
general configuration purposes, since it uses an RCL file such as <a
href="./source/software/src/microraptor/utils/exampleWatchList.rcl">this
one</a> to store its config.</div>

<h3>Sample code</h3>

<div class="content">mrapMonitor is a bit complicated for a starter
example, however.  Thus, here's a stripped-down version of mrapMonitor
to solely demonstrate MR_Comm (the Microraptor communications class),
and a very small bit of RCL (the Microraptor datastructure
library):</div>

<div class="content"><b>Note:</b> The below hasn't yet been tested; I
need to do so soon to make sure I didn't accidentally introduce any
bugs. :-)  Also todo: change this to autokill anything that sends
status, in order to demonstrate sending mraptor commands.</div>

addition to receiving them.  The various RCL headers in the rcl/
