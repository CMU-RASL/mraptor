<meta name="description" content="Microraptor documentation:
installation, configuration, and use.">
<h2>Overview</h2> 

<p>We provide a brief overview of Microraptor here; please see the
more detailed pages linked above if you would prefer in-depth explanations.</p>

<p>The Microraptor system consists of four binaries:

<ul>
 <li><b>central:</b>
   The IPC central server that routes all message traffic between
   clients and daemons (part of the <a
   href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ipc">IPC distribution</a>)
 </li>
 <li><b>mraptord:</b>
   The daemon.  An instance of the daemon must be run on each
   host where you want the system to manage processes.  Daemons
   interact with clients by executing commands and forwarding
   status information.
 </li>
 <li><b>claw:</b>
   The graphical client.  Its interface allows you to run/kill
   processes, interact with their consoles, etc.
 </li>
 <li><b>mrterm:</b>
   A simple console-based client that allows you to connect
   to a single daemon and issue the same commands that claw
   generates through its interface.
 </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>In order to minimally run microraptor you do the following (you may want
to do this in separate xterms):

<ol>
 <li>start central</li>
 <li>start an instance of mraptord</li>
 <li>start one of the clients (claw or mrterm; claw is much
 nicer)</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Note that if you are running one of the binaries on a different
host from where the central server is running, you need to say
where central is located:
<pre class="indent">
$> setenv CENTRALHOST &lt;host central is on&gt;
$> &lt;run binary&gt;
</pre>
</p>

<p>In order to do anything useful, you will need to load a config
file.  An example config file can be found in
src/microraptor/daemon/example.config if you built from source, or <a
href="/source/software/src/microraptor/daemon/example.config">here</a>.
A config file can be loaded either with a command-line option to
mraptord:</p>

<pre class="indent">$> mraptord -c example.config </pre>

<p>or by using the [Main]->[Load Local Config File] command in claw.
</p>

<p>All of the binaries print usage help if you specify the '-h' option.</p>


<h3>Misc Documentation Files</h3>

<p class="content"> Here are links to a few of the documentation files
in the current Microraptor distribution.  Note that anything dealing with
installation / startup is likely out of date - I haven't had time to
rewrite these docs since the switch to RPMs for non-CMU installs.</p>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <a href="/source/software/src/microraptor/docs/mraptor_manual.txt">
      Main Microraptor documentation (incomplete) 
    </a>.  Note that this has been superseded by this website, and may
    become out of date over time.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/source/software/src/microraptor/scripts/mraptord.rpm.sysv.txt">
       SysV startup script for mraptor
    </a>
    .  See script for customization details; you'll also need to set
    up appropriate links in your rcX.d directories if you didn't
    install from RPM.  This is the script which is installed as
    /etc/init.d/mraptord if you install from the RPM.
