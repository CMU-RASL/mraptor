source RPM (i.e. SRPM).">
<h2>Source RPM instructions</h2>

<p>If there isn't a binary RPM available on the <a
href="./index.html?page=download">downloads page</a> that will do the
trick for your system, you'll need to build one from the source RPM
(available from <a href="./index.html?page=download">there</a> as well).
Here are some barebones instructions on building Microraptor from the SRPM:

<ol>
   <li class="spaced">Ensure that the IPC headers and libraries can be found by the
    build process. Either install the <a
    href="./index.html?page=download#ipc">IPC RPM</a> or symlink
    /usr/lib/libipc.a to your existing IPC library and
    /usr/include/ipc to the /include subdirectory of your IPC
    installation. </li>
   <li class="spaced"><pre>rpm --rebuild mraptor-1.0.1-1.src.rpm</pre>
   as root (substituting the appropriate version number).  Note that
   on some newer RedHat systems it's <i>rpmbuild --rebuild</i> instead
   of <i>rpm --rebuild</i>.
    </li>

   <li class="spaced">This will drop a set of binary RPMs
   (<i>mraptor-[server|claw|mrterm|util|dev</i>) in
   /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/. Install them the usual way:
   <pre>rpm -ivh &lt;rpmname&gt;</pre> See <a
   href="./index.html?page=docs.install.rpm">the RPM installation
   page</a> for more verbose RPM instructions.
   </li>

   <li>Drop us an email with a brief description of your system (Linux
   flavor, flavor's version number, and compiler at a bare minimum:
   e.g. "stock RedHat Enterprise 3.0, gcc 3.2.3"), what problems you
   had with the RPMs above, and a pointer to where I can get your RPM.
   Thanks!</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p> Your spiffy new binary RPMs can then be used to install Microraptor on
any other similar machines you have.</p>
