<meta name="description" content="Build instructions for compiling
Microraptor from the source.">
<h2> Use the Source, Luke! </h2>

<p>While we heartily recommend installing from an RPM, sometimes you
just need to Use The Source(tm). ;-)  One warning: Microraptor currently lives in
the <a href="http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/atacama/">Life in the
Atacama</a> CVS repository, and while we've managed to make its build
process independent of the main LITA build, the directory structure is
still somewhat screwy.</p>

<h4>System requirements</h4>

<p>Microraptor has currently only been used under Linux.  It has been
tested successfully with a variety of tool versions, but unfortunately
we don't have a comprehensive list.  Here are several configurations of
tools that are known to work:</p>

<ul>
  <li>RedHat Linux 7.1 with CMU CS Facilities modifications, kernel 2.4.18</li>
  <li>g++ 2.96 and 3.2.3</li>
  <li>GNU Bison version 1.28</li>
  <li>GNU Flex version 2.5.4</li>
  <li>GNU Make version 3.79.1</li>
  <li>GTK 1.2.9 and 1.2.10 (needed for graphical client only)</li>
  <li>CMU IPC 3.7.4 through 3.7.10: (<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ipc">IPC</a> is
  a locally developed inter-process communications library; any
  version newer than 3.7.4 should work)</li>
</ul>

<p>The majority of claw (the GUI) development was done using:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Debian Testing (Woody), kernel 2.4.18</li>
  <li>g++ 2.95.4</li>
  <li>GNU Bison version 1.75</li>
  <li>GNU Flex version 2.5.4</li>
  <li>GNU Make 3.79.1</li>
  <li>CMU IPC 3.7.4</li>
</ul>

  <p>and, more recently...</p>

<ul>
  <li>Debian Testing (Sarge), kernel 2.4.18</li>
  <li>g++ 2.95.4</li>
  <li>GNU Bison version 1.875a</li>
  <li>GNU Flex version 2.5.4</li>
  <li>GNU Make 3.80</li>
  <li>CMU IPC 3.7.4</li>
</ul>

  <p>We've also used newer systems, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>RedHat Linux 9.0 with CMU CS Facilities modifications, kernel
  2.4.25</li>
  <li>g++ 3.2.2</li>
  <li>GNU Bison version 1.35</li>
  <li>GNU Flex version 2.5.4</li>
  <li>GNU Make version 3.79.1</li>
  <li>GTK 1.2.10 (needed for graphical client only)</li>
  <li>CMU IPC 3.7.7</li>
</ul>

  <p>and...</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fedora Core 3 with CMU CS Facilities modifications, kernel
  2.6.13</li>
  <li>g++ 3.4.2</li>
  <li>GNU Bison version 1.875c</li>
  <li>GNU Flex version 2.5.4</li>
  <li>GNU Make version 3.80</li>
  <li>GTK 1.2.10 (needed for graphical client only)</li>
  <li>CMU IPC 3.7.10</li>
</ul>


<p>We explicitly DO NOT support compilers with versions less than gcc
2.95.4.  We've run into the following problems:
    <ul>
      <li>egcs 2.91 does not provide enough template support for some of our
        support classes.</li>
      <li>gcc 2.95.3 has a bug in the std::string constructor from a char*
        that crashes spawned child processes.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p><i><b>NOTE:</b> As of 1.1.3-1, the problems related to gcc 3.4 have
been resolved. This note will remain for a time to inform anyone using
a pre-1.1.3 release.</i> Unfortunately, we've now also run into
problems with gcc 3.4, especially with its "support" of templates.
The gcc folk seem to be focusing on standards-compliance at any cost,
including breaking backwards-compliance.  We will eventually rewrite
the offending library to be strictly ANSI-compliant, but that'll be
rather thorny, as the code is... arcane.  In the meantime, stick to
gcc 3.2 (or possibly 3.3).  There are reports of 'gcc-compat' RPMs
being available for recent Fedore Core releases that seem to do the
trick.</p>

<p>We believe mraptor to now work properly under gcc 4.0, but no gcc 4
system is part of our release process, so I'm not positive. Please
report any success or failure.</p>

<h4>Setup and Compilation</h4>

<p>The Microraptor source tree expects to be installed under a software/
directory.  You must create an external/ directory in software/ which
includes the IPC installation (potentially via symlinks to a
previously-installed copy):</p>

<ul>

  <li>Choose a directory for your installation and do the following:
      <ul class="spaced">
        <li><span class="ic">setenv ATACAMA_MEMBERS_DIR &lt;your_dir&gt;</span></li>
        <li><span class="ic">mkdir $ATACAMA_MEMBERS_DIR/software</span></li>
      </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Set up the external directory under software to include the IPC
  installation (the requirement is that the following files be present):
      <ul class="spaced">
        <li>software/external/lib/linux2/libipc.a</li>
        <li>software/external/bin/linux2/central</li>
        <li>software/external/include/ipc.h</li>
      </ul>
  NOTE: These may need to be Linux-2.4 instead of linux2, depending on
  your system.  This will be fixed with the next release.
  </li>

<li>Install the Microraptor source.  Pick one: grabbing it from CVS
  (obviously requires CVS access; we do not support anonymous CVS
  access) or downloading the source tarball from <a
  href="./index.html?page=download">here</a>.
      <ul class="spaced">
        <li><b>CVS:</b>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="ic">cd $ATACAMA_MEMBERS_DIR/software</span></li>
            <li><span class="ic">setenv CVSROOT monk.frc.ri.cmu.edu:/user/atacama/software/master</span></li>
            <li><span class="ic">cvs checkout src/microraptor</span></li>
            <li><span class="ic">cvs checkout src/microraptor/atacama_env</span></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Tarball:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Download tarball from <a href="./index.html?page=download">here</a></li>
            <li><span class="ic">cd $ATACAMA_MEMBERS_DIR/software</span></li>
            <li><span class="ic">tar -xzf mraptor-&lt;version&gt;.tgz</span></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Pick up environment variables from atacama_env:
      <ul class="spaced">
        <li><span class="ic">source $ATACAMA_MEMBERS_DIR/software/src/atacama_env</span></li>
      </ul>
      NOTE: You must be running tcsh for this to work; we don't
      currently have a bash version of this (simple) script.
  </li>

  <li>Compile:<br>

        <p>If you don't want the binaries installed to
          $ATACAMA_MEMBERS_DIR/software/bin/<architecture>, set the
            RELEASE_HOME environment variable to your target directory
            before doing the following:

            <ul>
              <li><span class="ic">cd $ATACAMA_MEMBERS_DIR/software/src/microraptor</span></li>
              <li><span class="ic">gmake USER_CFLAGS="-g -O3" DEBUG_DEFUNCT=0 NO_XML=1 BUILD_UTILS=1 install</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p>This produces the following files, which should be in your path
              if you rehash:
              <ul>
                <li>software/bin/linux2/mraptord</li>
                <li>software/bin/linux2/mrterm</li>
                <li>software/bin/linux2/claw</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
        </p>
  </li>
  <li>Configure: That's it!  Move on to the <a
  href="./index.html?page=docs.config">configuration</a> page for
  instructions on getting your processes running under Microraptor.</li>
</ul>
