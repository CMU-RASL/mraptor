<h2>Using the Serial Client (mrterm)</h2>

<p>mrterm is the barebones text-based client interface to the
Microraptor network.  It provides the same functionality as <a
href="./index.html?page=docs.claw">claw</a> with respect to
interfacing with the daemon, without all that pesky graphical
stuff. :-)</p>

<p>mrterm is most useful for quick-and-dirty playing around with
Microraptor, especially if you don't have a system with GTK 1.2 (or X)
installed.  It's also handy within scripts, since its <span
class="ic">-e</span> option can be used to execute arbitrary
Microraptor commands.</p>

<h4>Options</h4>

<p>mrterm supports the following commandline arguments:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>-h</b> or <b>--help</b>:
  <div class="content">Print a summary of commandline
  arguments.</div></li>

  <li><b>-d &lt;host&gt;</b>:
  <div class="content">Sends commands to the daemon at the
  specified host.</div></li>

  <li><b>-e &lt;cmd&gt;</b>:
  <div class="content">Executes the specified command as if it
  had been sent to stdin.  Multiple commands can be specified using
  multiple instances of <span class="ic">-e</span>.</div></li>

  <li><b>-q</b>:
  <div class="content">Tells mrterm to quit after sending -e commands.</div></li>

  <li><b>-i</b>:
  <div class="content">Specifies that mrterm is being used interactively.
                 A prompt is provided, and some output becomes more
                 verbose.</div></li>

  <li><b>-v</b>:
  <div class="content">Tells mrterm to echo all comm
  traffic to console for debugging.</div></li>

  <li><b>--centralhost &lt;host&gt;</b>:
  <div class="content">Specify host/port where IPC
  central server is running (e.g. <span class="ic">--centralhost
  foo:1382</span>).</div></li>
</ul>

<h4>Commands</h4>
  
<p>The following commands are handled locally by mrterm.  Any input
not on this list will be forwarded to the daemon; see <i>The Daemon
Serial Interface</i> section on the <a
href="./index.html?page=docs.daemon">daemon page</a> for a detailed listing.</p>


<ul>
  <li><b>fg &lt;process_name&gt;</b>

    <p>Put &lt;process_name&gt; in the foreground.  While in
    foreground mode, mrterm simulates a console connected to the
    stdin/stdout of the given process.  In order to send a command to
    the mrterm instead, preface it with a '/' character.  for example,
    \"/bg\" puts the client back into background mode.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>bg</b>

    <p>Go back into background mode (the default mode), where what you type
    is interpreted as a command to the mrterm (either processed locally
    if the command is recognized as a local command, or forwarded to the
    daemon).</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>load &lt;config_file_name&gt;</b>

    <p>Causes mrterm to load a client-side config file and forward the
    information to the daemon using 'set' commands.  Use 'dload' to load a
    daemon-side config file.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>help (or 'h')</b>

    <p>Shows help on the mrterm and mraptord interfaces.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As mentioned above, all other commands are forwarded to the daemon
for processing.  See the <i>Daemon Serial Interface</i> on the <a
href="./index.html?page=docs.daemon#serialInterface">daemon page</a>.
