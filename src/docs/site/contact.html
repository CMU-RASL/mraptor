<h2> Contact Info </h2>

<p class="content">Microraptor was developed jointly by Trey Smith and
Brennan Sellner, with some input from Chris Urmson in the initial
planning stage.  For the most part, Trey developed the daemon
(mraptord) and text client (mrterm), while Brennan built the graphical
client interface (claw).</p>

<p class="content">For the time being, Brennan is the Microraptor
point of contact, and can be reached via email at 'brennan'
'plus-sign' 'mraptor' 'at' 'ri.cmu.edu'.</p>
