<h2>Using the Graphical Client (claw)</h2>

<div class="content">This needs to be extended with screenshots,
etc.</div>

<div class="content">Microraptor's graphical client is "claw", which
supports (relatively :-) intuitive access to the Microraptor system's
functionality, and makes it easy to monitor and control many processes
simultaneously.  As with all graphical programs, documentation is a
bit of a challenge; we've done our best here, and divide it into the
following sections (the shorter of which are included below, while the
longer have been separated out into their own pages):</div>

<a name="what">
<h3>What is it?</h3>

<div class="content">Curved and pointy.  It's also a GTK 1.2-based
graphical client to the Microraptor process startup / management
system.  Claw is run on a client machine (usually a remote / offboard
workstation, but occasionally the same machine as an mraptord daemon)
in order to allow the user to start, stop, monitor, and interact with
the processes defined in the current <a
href="./index.html?page=docs.config.writeConfig">process
configuration</a>.  These processes may run on any machine which is
running mraptord.  An arbitrary number of Claw instances can be
running at any one time (potentially listening to / interacting with
the same processes) on any number of client machines.  The
disconnection or failure of a client does not affect the operation of
the daemon nor the robot processes in any way.  This was one of our
major design goals: your control processes won't fail strangely just
because the robot managed to outrun your wireless connection to
it.</div>

<div class="content">Incidentally, there isn't a good reason for the
name <i>Claw</i>, except that dinosaurs have claws, and I was tired of
typing "microraptor" all the time.  A suitable acronym will be devised
at some point.  Feel free to suggest one.</div>

<a name="capabilities">
<h3>What Can Claw Do?</h3>

<div class="content">Everything! ;-) Seriously, the quickest / easiest
way to learn how to use claw is to play with the sucker.  Once you've
defined a <a href="./index.html?page=docs.config.writeConfig">process
configuration</a> and loaded it into the Microraptor network, just <a
href="./index.html?page=docs.claw.args">start up Claw</a> and start
poking around. If you're impatient, the <a
href="./index.html?page=docs.claw.keys">Shortcut Reference</a> will
give you a quick idea of what's available.</div>

<div class="content">Claw implements the full commandset described in
<a href="./index.html?page=docs.daemon#serialInterface">The Daemon
Serial Interface</a>; see <a
href="./index.html?page=docs.claw.mapping">Serial Interface -> GUI
Elements Mapping</a> for an exhaustive (and we <i>do</i> mean
exhausting!) list of the various ways to invoke the primitive
commands.</div>

<a name="walkthrough">
<h3>Walkthrough</h3>

<div class="content">Write me!</div>

<div class="content">See the <a
href="./index.html?page=docs.config.claw">Claw entry</a> on the <a
href="./index.html?page=docs.config">Config</a> page for information
on how to configure Claw's preferences.</div>

<a name="layout">
<h3>GUI Layout</h3>

<div class="content">Write me!  This should be the quick reference to
the Claw GUI: a numbered image with names for everything.  This will
probably be sucked into the walkthrough.</div>

<a name="swallowing">
<h3>Claw and X Windows</h3>

<div class="content">As a curiosity, we've implemented generic window
swallowing within Claw: arbitrary X windows may be pulled into the
Claw interface, and will be placed into a tab alongside the
currently-viewed processes' output.</div>

<div class="content">To initiate a swallow, either press <span
class="ic">Ctrl+Z</span>, or choose the <span class="ic">Main->Swallow
Window</span> menu option.  Your cursor will change to a small
'+'-sign: click on any X window, and it will be swallowed into a new
tab in Claw's process interaction area.  To unswallow (regurgitate?) a
swallowed window, click on the <img src="./images/throwupButton.png">
button above and to the right of the swallowed window.  To close a
swallowed window, click on the <img src="./images/hideButton.png">
button (this is equivalent to closing the window if it had remained
under control of the window manager).</div>

<div class="content">Due to some fundamental timing / race issues
associated with generic swallowing, this GTK functionality has been
deprecated in favor of the Plug/Socket interface (which requires
explicit code in both processes), but we're keeping it in Claw because
it's nifty :-).  You will occasionally see weird things such as empty
frames left behind after a swallow; unfortunately, there's no reliable
fix for this.  Further note that the window will be forced to the size
of Claw's process interaction area, which may result in it looking
rather odd.</div>

<div class="content">Despite the occasional strangenesses, we still
find this functionality useful, since it provides a quick way to bring
all windows associated with control of your system together into a
(more-or-less organized) whole.  This is no substitute for
custom-crafted GUIs if you have a plethora of graphical readouts or
controls you would like to use, but it is a quick-and-dirty temporary
solution.</div>

<a name="caveats">
<h3>Implementation Caveats / Design Decisions</h3>

<ol>
   <li>The "idle time" display at the top of each process display
   window and in the third column of the tree display is the number of
   seconds since the process last output something to stdout.  This is
   updated every time the client receives a stdout line.  Also, in the
   event that you aren't subscribed to a given process, the client
   pings the daemon for status information (including the last time a
   line was printed out) every thirty seconds.</li>

   <li>There are no guards against simultaneous interaction: you're
   free to step on the toes of other claw users.</li>
</ol>
